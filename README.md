# Errata

Errata that I discovered in the books I studied.
Almost of these have been shared with the author(s) and they have included them in their official errata lists.

## Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd Edition (Global Edition)

## Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 2nd Edition

This book by Bryant and O'Hallaron is one of my favorite Computer Science textbooks.
It was so detailed and interesting that I studied some chapters in detail, working out the practice problems.
The US edition of this book has an official [errata list](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/errata.html) to which I was able to contribute one of my own discoveries.

## Algorithms, 4th Edition

This introductory algorithms book by Sedgewick and Wayne is my favorite book on the topic.
It was so engrossing that I ended up studying it back-to-back.
I was pleasantly surprised to discover some previously undiscovered errata that I contributed to the authors' official [2nd printing errata list](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/errata/errata-printing2.php).
